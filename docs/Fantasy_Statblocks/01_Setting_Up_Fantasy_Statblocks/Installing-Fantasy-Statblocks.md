# Installing Fantasy Statblocks

## Option 1: Community Plugins
From Obsidian **v0.9.8**, you can able to install from the *Community Plugins Menu* by completing the following.

1. Step 1
Open your **Obsidian Settings**.

> If you are unsure how to access Obsidian Settings, check out these instructions by the [Obsidian Documentation Team](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Change+settings).

2. Step 2
Navigate to **Community Plugins** on the left side of the settings menu and select it.

3. Step 3
Navigate to the **Browse** button on the right side of the settings menu, and select it.

> If **Restricted Mode** is enabled, you may be prompted to ==Turn on Community Plugins== first. 

4. Step 4
Search for "Fantasy Statblocks" in the **Search Bar** up top.

5. Step 5
Select the "Fantasy Statblocks" search result, and select **Install**. 

6. Step 6
Once the plugin has installed, the install button will change to **Enable**.

7. Step 7. 
When ready, select **Enable** and either [View the Fantasy Statblock Settings](Statblock-Plugin-Settings.md) or **Close the Settings Menu**.

You have succeeded in installing Fantasy Statblocks through the Obsidian Community Plugins Menu. 


## Option 2: Manual Installation from Github

If you do not wish to, or are unable, to use the Community Plugins Menu from within Obsidian, you are also able to install Fantasy Statblocks manually.



1. Step 1


-   Download the Latest Release from the Releases section of the GitHub Repository
-   Extract the plugin folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`  
    Note: On some machines the `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On MacOS you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder.
-   Reload Obsidian
-   If prompted about Safe Mode, you can disable safe mode and enable the plugin. Otherwise head to Settings, third-party plugins, make sure safe mode is off and enable the plugin from there.
