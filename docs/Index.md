# Javalant's Plugins

Welcome to Javalant's Plugins for **[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)**. You know 'em, you love 'em, now here is how to use them. 



## The Valantasy System

A word from documentation writer, @Sigrunixia...

> Many plugin's have been created within the Valantasy System Framework and are oriented towards the Table Top Roleplaying community of Obsidian. Designed to work great independently, but excel when combined with their Valantasy counterparts, these plugins are the staple and foundation for much of the table-top community growth within Obsidian. This community would not have gotten here today were it not for the efforts of Javalant, and so this documentation hub is our thank you.
